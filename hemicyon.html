    <h2>About Hemicyon</h2>
    <p>give me a brief of hemicyon animal their habitat,diet etc
        ChatGPT
        Hemicyon, commonly known as "bear dogs," were an extinct family of prehistoric mammals that lived during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs, around 30 to 10 million years ago. Here's a brief overview of Hemicyon:<br>
        
        <b>Habitat:</b><br>
        Hemicyon species inhabited a variety of environments, including forests, woodlands, and grasslands in Eurasia and North America. These areas provided them with diverse ecosystems and prey.<br>
        
        <b>Appearance:</b><br> 
        Hemicyon resembled a combination of bears and dogs, hence their common name. They typically had a robust, bear-like body with elongated limbs, making them somewhat similar in appearance to modern-day canids (dogs).<br>
        
        <b>Diet:</b><br> 
        Hemicyon were carnivorous predators. Their diet primarily consisted of meat, including smaller mammals such as rodents and ungulates. Some larger species might have even hunted larger prey.<br>
        
        <b>Social Structure:</b><br>
        While not much is known about the social behavior of Hemicyon, it is believed that they might have been solitary predators or lived in small family groups.<br>
        
        <b>Extinction:</b><br> 
        Hemicyon went extinct during the Miocene epoch, likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in climate and the emergence of more specialized carnivorous predators.<br>
        
        These ancient bear dogs hold a fascinating place in the evolutionary history of mammals, bridging the gap between the dog-like and bear-like lineages. Their fossils have provided valuable insights into the past ecosystems and the evolution of carnivorous mammals</p><br><br>
